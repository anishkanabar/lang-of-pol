# Language of Policing

This repository exists for collaborative development of code associated with the NIH-funded "Primed to (re)act" project's computational tasks and analysis.

## Notebooks/documentation

The `docs` and `notebooks` folders have been created to facilitate documentation and development, respectively. For now, feel free to treat these as scratch spaces, though be sure to define variables like working directories early in the code.
