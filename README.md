# Language of Policing

This repository exists for collaborative development of code associated with the NIH-funded "Primed to (re)act" project's computational tasks and analysis.

## Access/authorship

Since it is a private repository, sub-projects/tasks and involved personnel will be recorded here to denote division of labor and facilitate auditing. Access will be granted on a "need to function" basis, thus some contributors' code will be updated by those with access but authorship of that code will always be clear.
